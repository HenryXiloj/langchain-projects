# LangChain Projects

A growing set of LangChain experiments and agents. Each folder is a complete, runnable project.

## Projects

- [langchain-tavily-search-agent](langchain-tavily-search-agent/README.md) - Web search agent using Tavily + LangChain.

## Quick Start

2. Follow that project's `README.md`.

## Notes

- Keep `.env` files local; never commit secrets.
- Each project can have its own Python version and dependencies.
