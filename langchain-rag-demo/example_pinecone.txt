Pinecone is a managed vector database designed for machine learning and AI applications.

It stores vector embeddings generated by models such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Hugging Face.

Pinecone is commonly used for:
- Semantic search
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Recommendation systems
- Chatbots with long-term memory

Pinecone handles indexing, scaling, and fast similarity search without requiring users
to manage infrastructure.
